#  What Improved Here?

###  1. Proper Constants

```python
API_URL = ...
OUTPUT_FILE = ...
```

No hardcoded values inside functions.

---

###  2. try/except for API Failure

Handles:

* No internet
* DNS failure
* Timeout
* 404/500 errors

---

###  3. Safe Dictionary Access

```python
post.get("id")
```

Prevents `KeyError`.

---

###  4. File Error Handling

Prevents crash if:

* No permission
* Disk full
* Path invalid

---

###  5. Cleaner Structure

Each function:

* Does ONE job
* Has docstring
* Has clear variable names
