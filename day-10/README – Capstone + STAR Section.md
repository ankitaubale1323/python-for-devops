## 🚀 Python for DevOps – Capstone Project

### 📌 Project Overview
This project automates DevOps-related tasks using Python.  
It includes:

- Log analysis using Python
- CLI-based execution
- AWS automation using Boto3
- FastAPI wrapper for API exposure (optional)

The goal was to solve a real-world operational problem using automation.

## ⭐ Project Explanation (S.T.A.R Method)

### 🟢 S – Situation
Application logs were growing daily and manually checking logs for errors was time-consuming and inefficient.

### 🟢 T – Task
My responsibility was to automate log analysis using Python so that errors and critical issues could be identified quickly without manual inspection.

### 🟢 A – Action
- Wrote a Python script to parse log files
- Counted different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Added CLI support using argparse
- Implemented AWS integration using Boto3 (for example: S3 log upload or EC2 interaction)
- Exposed functionality via FastAPI for API access

### 🟢 R – Result
- Reduced manual log-checking effort
- Provided quick visibility into system errors
- Demonstrated automation, scripting, and DevOps thinking
- Created a reusable and scalable solution
