**What Changed (And Why It Matters)**
**Before (Day 04)**

Functions floating independently

Data passed around manually

# **Now (Day 05)**

Log file + counters stored inside object

Behavior grouped with state

Cleaner structure

Easier to extend later

Now imagine tomorrow you want to:

Add threshold alerts

Add JSON output

Add email notifications

Add CLI arguments

With OOP → easy.

Without structure → messy.
